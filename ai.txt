Artificial intelligence (AI) matters because it simulates human intelligence in machines, enabling them to learn, reason, make decisions, and automate repetitive tasks with high speed and precision. AI plays a transformative role across industries, improving efficiency and accuracy, reducing human errors, and enhancing capabilities in areas like healthcare, finance, and smart technology. Its potential to process vast datasets and adapt through machine learning also allows for innovative solutions to complex global problems.
